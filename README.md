Cryptographic Deception System with ML-Based Intrusion Detection

A hybrid security framework that uses plausible fake encrypted data to deceive attackers and identify suspicious behaviour. This project creates a honeypot-like deception system by combining AES and RSA encryption, brute-force detection, and ML-driven behavior analysis.
